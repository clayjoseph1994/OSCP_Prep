I'm extremely excited to create this open source project and to collaborate with individuals interested in or pursuing OSCP licensure.
I've only ever used my git repos for personal use, so this is not going to follow the formatting seen in most other repos. 
If you want to add anything, feel free to do so (no malware unless explicitly stated as such with a warning/disclaimer)
